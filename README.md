# Credit Card Java Application

## Synopsis:

## Deliverables:
The primary problem that we are trying to solve is to determine which credit card belongs to which card type from the given card number by matching the pattern provided.

The secondary problem that we are trying to solve is to choose a design pattern appropriate to implement the above which will create the object of correct card type and if the card number is a valid number or not. 


The design patterns implemented are:
1. Factory Method Pattern
2. Iterator Pattern
3. Strategy Pattern

The Class Diagrams for these design patterns are as follows:

1. Factory Method Pattern

2. Iterator Pattern

3. Strategy Pattern

- Below are the consequences of using these patterns: 
Factory method will delegate the decision of creating the correct card type object on the helper subclass
Iterator method will help to access the aggregate objects contents without displaying the representation
Strategy pattern will help to separate the logic of handling different types of input files who have different implementation
